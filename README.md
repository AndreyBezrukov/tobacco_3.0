# Motivation
Our Topologically Based Crystal Constructor (ToBaCCo) was developed to rapidly produce molecular representations of porous crystals as crystallographic information (.cif) files, which can then be used for molecular simulation or for materials characterization. 

# Installation and Dependencies
We recommend building a Python 2.7 environment using Anaconda. You will need the following packages:
numpy
networkx
scipy

# Usage
Execute the tobacco.py file to run ToBaCCo:
```
python tobacco.py
```
For more details on ToBaCCo inputs, outputs, and configuration see the ToBaCCo_manual.pdf included with the repository.
